# 3D-Object-detection
In this GitHub project, our objective is to access point cloud data from the Kitti dataset. We will perform various operations and processing tasks on this data, including downsampling, segmentation, and clustering. Ultimately, the project aims to detect objects within the point cloud by employing bounding box techniques.
